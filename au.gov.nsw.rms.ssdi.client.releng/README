Follow the wiki (http://tsm-wiki/display/LINKVIEW/SBOM+Eclipse+workspace+setup) to:

1) Install buckminster
2) Setup proxy bypass for local machines. Make sure you include 'tmb-bs-tmis01' which hosts the eclipse mirror for juno
2) Setup SVN including user name and password string substitutions
3) Create an empty target platform
4) Open build-local.cquery OR build.cquery
5) Click on Resolve & Materialise

Note, Resolve & Materialise is a lot faster with 'build-local.cquery' than 'build.cqery' as it uses a local eclipse mirror
